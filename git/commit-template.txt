# ----------------------------
# ✅ Official Commit Types:
# - feat:      A new feature
# - fix:       A bug fix
# - docs:      Documentation only changes
# - style:     Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting)
# - refactor:  A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - perf:      A code change that improves performance
# - test:      Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones
# - build:     Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# - ci:        Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
# - chore:     Maintenance or tasks that don’t affect production code
# - revert:    Reverts a previous commit

# 🎯 Optional Scope:
# Specify the part of the codebase affected in parentheses.
# Example: feat(blog), fix(lsp), chore(dotfiles)

# 🤓 Guidelines:
# - Limit subject line to 72 characters
# - Use the imperative mood: "add" not "added"
# - Leave a blank line between subject and body (if writing a long commit)
# - Use body to explain *why* the change was made

# 💡 Bonus Funky Flair (optional emojis):
