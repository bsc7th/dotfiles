# Conventional Commit Template

<type>(<scope>): <subject> [optional emoji]

# ----------------------------
# Official Commit Types:
# - feat:      A new feature
# - fix:       A bug fix
# - docs:      Documentation only changes
# - style:     Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting)
# - refactor:  A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# - perf:      A code change that improves performance
# - test:      Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones
# - build:     Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# - ci:        Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
# - chore:     Maintenance or tasks that donâ€™t affect production code
# - revert:    Reverts a previous commit

# Guidelines:
# - Limit subject line to 72 characters
# - Use the imperative mood: "add" not "added"
# - Leave a blank line between subject and body (if writing a long commit)
# - Use body to explain *why* the change was made
