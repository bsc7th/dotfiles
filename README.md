Most of my plugins come from [Folke's](https://github.com/folke) Neovim config, with a few others from talented developers at Neovim Spectrum. My workflow is inspired by [Josean Martinez's](https://github.com/josean-dev) and [Takuya Matsuyama](https://github.com/craftzdog), also known as [craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog) or [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=devaslife) on YouTube. You can also check [Neovim website](https://neovim.io/) as a guide, as it provides detailed information on each plugins helping you better understand how things work.

If you need detailed, beginner-friendly guidelines on how to set up Neovim from scratch, I highly recommend the following:
