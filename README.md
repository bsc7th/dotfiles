**Important**: Most of my plugins come from [Folke's](https://github.com/folke) Neovim config, with a few others from great developers at Neovim Spectrum. My workflow is inspired by [Josean Martinez's](https://github.com/josean-dev?tab=repositories) and [Takuya Matsuyama](https://github.com/craftzdog), also known as craftzdog or devaslife on YouTube. I recommend checking it out yourself instead of blindly cloning any repository. You can also use the [Neovim website](https://neovim.io/) as a guide, it provides quite a bit of detail on each repository, giving you a better understanding of how things work.
